# Analysis of the relationship between the country’s economy and the change in its climate

A Nation’s push to boost its economy may have some negative impacts on its climate. This project intends to study the impacts of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) on the surface temperature of the country. This project will consider two factors i.e. GDP & Rise in surface temperature of 5 different countries across 60 years of time and document any direct correlations between the both factors. This project integrates data from Kaggle datasets “World GDP by Country” and “Climate change indicators” and tries to identify any underlying patterns in the data.
