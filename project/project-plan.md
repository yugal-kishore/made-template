GDP is a growth analysis factor and climate change is a probelem needed to be tackled, This project tries to peek into the relation between the two concepts and see if they are correlated. 

## Datasources

This dataset contains the GDP of every country from 1960 to 2022.

The GDP figures are measured in current U.S. dollars and represent the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in each country's economy. This encompasses not only the production value but also takes into account any product taxes while subtracting subsidies that are not included in the value of products.
