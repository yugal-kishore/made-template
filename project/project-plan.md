# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate change and it's impact by GDP of the country
## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1.Is there a direct connection between the Change in surface and the GDP of a Nation?
## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
GDP is a growth analysis factor and climate change is a probelem needed to be tackled, This project tries to peek into the relation between the two concepts and see if they are correlated. 

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Kaggle
* Data Type: CSV
* API link: kaggle datasets download -d rajkumarpandey02/2023-world-population-by-country

The US Census Bureau's world population clock estimated that the global population as of September 2022 was 7,922,312,800 people and was expected to reach 8 billion by mid-November of 2022. This total far exceeds the 2015 world population of 7.2 billion. The world's population continues to increase by roughly 140 people per minute, with births outweighing deaths in most countries.

### Datasource2: Kaggle
* Data Type: CSV
* API link: kaggle datasets download -d berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data

Some say climate change is the biggest threat of our age while others say itâ€™s a myth based on dodgy science. We are turning some of the data over to you so you can form your own view.
